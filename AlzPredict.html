<div class="content">
  <p>AlzPredict is a unique early detection test for Alzheimerâ€™s. We use Machine Learning 
    to help us provide the most accurate results. Additionally, our product uses Mass 
    Spectrometry and Proteomics to identify the science behind the early diagnosis prediction. 
    We currently sell our product to private practice endocrinologists through a pilot program
    in New York City. Our product is non-invasive, accurate, and can diagnose up to 10 years 
    before disease onset.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How was AlzPredict developed?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Our team (shown on the ProPredict page) has expertise at the Ph.D. level in 
    neuroscience,  machine learning, bioengineering, and business. By working 
    intersectionality, we were able to come up with a blood assay, which, when used 
    in conjunction with our ML model, provides an accurate and easy prediction of 
    Alzheimer's. The Healthcare Hackathon, hosted by Cornell University has served 
    as an incubator of sorts, providing the team with resources and mentorship. We 
    would like to take this space to formally thank all of the mentors and sponsors 
    involved in the Hackathon!
